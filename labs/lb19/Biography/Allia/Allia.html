<p> I like to try new things and enjoy learning. I am in this class to learn how to design and create websites. In this class I like how I can use my own imagination to create something I never thought I'd be able to make. This class allows me to be creative and really pushes my limits and allows me to grow as a student. Soemtimes this class can get frustrating but it helps me to work on my patience; something that's been a goal of mine for a while. I want my future career to be a nurse. Coding can help me in the future to possibly get a side job or create a website of my own or even for a friend.</p>
