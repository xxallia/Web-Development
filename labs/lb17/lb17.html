       <p> The career that I would like have is nursing. I feel connected to the nursing field and I have a very strong liking to it. I admire everything about this job. I am interested in working in the medical field. I have always been interested in the human body and the way it works. I find it fascinating how the body parts and each cell work together unanimously. Working in the medical field would allow me to experience this firsthand.</p> 
   <p>You can always change your specialization. Letâ€™s say I wanted to be a nurse. I could be a travel nurse, ER nurse, Family nurse practitioner (FNT), etc. You never have to grow tired of your specialty.  You can always increase your knowledge in the medical field.Working in the medical field is an incredibly humbling experience. Each day you'll find another reason to be thankful for health because you will be treating those who aren't as fortunate as you are. Additionally, workers in the medical field are typically well paid. The average salary for a physician assistant is 90K. </p>
    <p> In terms of college, I'd like to go to a community college. The reason for this is that it is afforable and close to home. However, this does't mean that I wouldn't like to go to a college such as Hunter or York. If I were to go to community college, I would want to go to Queens Community college or a CUNY/SUNY college.</p>
