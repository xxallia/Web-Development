<h2> Hijab (الحجاب)</h2>
    <p> By definition hijab is a head covering worn by muslim women. But have you ever wondered why? Hijab is more than just a piece of clothing. That piece of cloth represents how you carry yourself and how you treat others. Hijab is a sign of faith and modesty. Hijab is a big part of my life. To add on hijab is not only for your hair. It is for your entire body. Wearing hijab doesn't necessarily mean that you have to cover your hair. It means your entire body as well. It means that you should wear loose clothing that do not show your skin or figure. Usually you may see hijabi's wearing dresses or baggy pants and long shirts. See examples below.</p>
