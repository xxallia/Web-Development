  <h2> Faith.</h2>
  <img src="masjid.jpg" width="350px"height="250px">
  <p> The faith that I follow is Islam. Islam is a monotheistic religion. Muslims believe in worshipping Allah. He is the creator, provider and controller of all things. Followers of Islam devote their life to Allah. Being a muslim is the biggest part of my life. Almost all of my actions are based on my religion. Islam teaches you to be patient and kind. It teaches you to have trust in  Allah (god). It teaches me to have a positive outlook on things no matter the situation. Let's say for example, the worst most unimaginable things are happening to me, my main concern would be having faith and strength in Allah. By doing this I am not stressed looking at the situation I am currently in. Rather I'm looking foward to the future. Another way Islam positively impacts my life is teaching me to be patient. Whenever I get upset, I try not to do anything that I will regret in the future because I like to keep in mind that Allah loves people who have patience. </p>
  <h2> Praying </h2>

  <p> A Muslim is obligated to pray 5 times a day. The holy day of the week for Muslims are Fridays. On this day a special prayer called is conducted during noon at mosques. Prayer keeps me connected to Allah. To make it easier for me to pray, I try to think about praying as me and Allah having small conversations. Prayers are one of the main ways that a muslim worships and reminds themselves of Allah. </p> 
  <h2> Ramadan</h2>

  <p> Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. During the month Muslims fast for 30 days. The purpose of this month is to devote everything to Allah. Many Muslims cut back on sins such as listening to music, cursing, dating etc. In the month of Ramadan, there are countless oppurtunities to seek forgiveness and gain double the amount of blessings. </p>
