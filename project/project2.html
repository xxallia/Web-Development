   <p> This movie is about a teenage boy who kills anyone he looks at. Basically his faced is always cover and his eyes aswell. Anyone he looks at immediately dies. He falls in love with a girl. She stays with him through thick and thin. She was very caring and patient. However she is also dealing with a disease.
