 <p> 1) To come up with ideas for this project I thought about summer 2020. During that time I watched a lot of movies and I was trying to think back to that time to remember which ones I liked the most. I knew I wanted the background color to be red because this color reminds me of movie premieres and red carpets. I created my prototype on google slides because I felt that it would showcase my imgaination even more than on paper.
   <br> 
 <p> 2) I learned how to insert links and images without looking back onto previous labs. 
   <br> 
<p> 3) The hardest part was getting my banner to display. 
  <br>
<p> 4) To fix this issue, I created a duplicate of my banner and tried again. I also checked for any mistakes and typos. 
  <br>
<p> 5) The color scheme for each of the movie pages I created were based entirely on the color scheme of the movie poster. </p>
