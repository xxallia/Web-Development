    <p> The first movie I decided to include in this project is "Spiderman-Homecoming." This movie is apart of the marvel spiderman series. It was created in 2017. In this movie Peter Parker starts to embrace being spriderman. Hiding his true identity becomes even hard to manage and someone very close to him from his school found out his secret. As if that wasn't stressful enough, Spiderman has a new task at hand. A new villan is introduced. This time the villan has a powerful weapon. Spidermans job is to take the weapon away before things get out of control. </p>
